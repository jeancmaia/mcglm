The algorithm leads to clean easily identifiable convergence and provides a means of verifying that the solution obtained is at least a local maximum of the likelihood function. It is shown that a popular iteration algorithm is numerically unstable under conditions which are encountered in practice and that, as a result, inaccurate solutions have been presented in the literature. The key result is a computationally feasible formula for the second differential of a partially maximized form of the likelihood function. In addition to implementing the Newton-Raphson algorithm, this formula provides a means for estimating the asymptotic variances and covariances of the maximum likelihood estimators.}",

For a one-parameter exponential family the log likelihood is the same as the quasi-likelihood and it follows that assuming a one-parameter exponential family is the weakest sort of distributional assumption that can be made. The Gauss-Newton method for calculating nonlinear least squares estimates generalizes easily to deal with maximum quasi-likelihood estimates, and a rearrangement of this produces a generalization of the method described by Nelder Wedderburn (1972).}",
